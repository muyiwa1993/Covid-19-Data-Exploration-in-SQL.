In this Project, I explore Covid-19 Death and Vaccination I got from WHO website. I initially did a little bit of data cleaning in excel before importing the file to SQL. 
In SQL, I explore;
1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths i.e the likelyhood of dying if one contact Covid-19 in Nigeria.
2. Total Cases vs Population i.e the chance of being diagnosed with Covid-19.
3. What countries has Highest Infection Rate compared to Population.
4. What countries has the Highest Death Count per Population.
5. Which are the contintents with the highest death count per population.
6. Worldwide infection and death case summary.
7. Total Population vs Population Vaccinated i.e the Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine.
8. Use of CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query.
9. Use of Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query.
10. created View to store data for later visualizations.
